# Computer Code

> custom computer code that allows readers to repeat the results.

## About

There are one code file: Geometry.ipynb.

The notations in the code are consistent with those in the manuscript.

The order of the code is aligned with that of the manuscript.

## Instructions

The code is organized into an ipython notebook. 

The software, module and hardware list is given below.

* Software

> Python 3.7.3 and above

* Module

name | version | build | channel 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
numpy | 1.16.2  | py37hacdab7b_0 | 
sympy | 1.3 | py37_0 | 
matplotlib | 3.0.3 | py37h54f8f79_0 |
seaborn | 0.9.0 | py37_0 | 
mpl_toolkits 
warnings 

> If we have matplotlib installed, we would be able to import mpl_toolkits directly.

* OS

> Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux


We use Anaconda GUI to run our code (which includes all the packages required). Otherwise, we may run `pip install` with the name and version for every candidate item.


### Get Started

The figures are saved in the folder below.
```python
'./figures/'
```

We can change the corresponding 
```python
_Figure_PATH_
```
if needed.

### How to Obtain the Expressions and Figures

More detailed explanations are given in the comments and markdown notes.
